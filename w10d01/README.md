# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [ ] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [ ] MVC Review
- [ ] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [ ] Nested Resources

### Rails Week Convo
* Liked the rails docs a lot
* rails is no fluff
* syntax was very diff from other languages
* enjoyed active record
* rails is awesome/simple, oop is a bit forced
* initially troublesome to get it to work
* language is implicit (on rails)
* folders/files are easy to navigate (once you wrap your head around MVC)
* even the smallest project requires dozens of files/folders

### MVC
* Model - responsible for talking to the db, represents the data
* View - template/template engine, helper functions
* Controller - brains of the operation, links the other two together

MVC
MVVM Model View View-Model
MVW - Model View Whatever

```rb
my_hash = {
  "username" => "jstamos",
  :password => "1234"
}

my_hash = {
  password: "1234"
}

my_hash["username"]
my_hash[:password]

:symbol.to_s
"my_string".to_sym
```
